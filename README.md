# A-World-Away-Hunting-for-Exoplanets-with-AI

Our project, "A World Away: Hunting for Exoplanets with AI," is a full-stack web application designed to streamline the discovery of exoplanets. We developed a machine learning model using Python and scikit-learn that analyzes stellar light curve data to predict the presence of transiting exoplanets. This predictive model is deployed with a Flask backend, which exposes a simple API for classification. The frontend is a user-friendly React application, allowing users to interact with the model and visualize results.

This solution directly addresses the challenge of analyzing the immense volume of data generated by telescopes like Kepler and TESS. By automating the initial detection phase with a Random Forest classifier, our tool can rapidly identify promising exoplanet candidates from raw data, a task that would be incredibly time-consuming for human astronomers.

The importance of this project lies in its ability to accelerate the search for new worlds. By making exoplanet detection faster and more accessible, we can more efficiently identify targets for further study, which is a critical step in the ongoing quest to find habitable planets and potentially, life beyond Earth.
